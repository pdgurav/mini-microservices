* Creating Docker image:
    Dockerfile: config to define how container should behave, then provide to Docker Client

*   Docker Client takes config and create Usable Image 

*   Creating a Dockerfile
        Specify a base image
        Run some additional commands to install additional programs
        Specify a command to run on container setup


* create an image that runs redis-server


*   once Docker is created use following commands:
    1) docker build . (building an image, return container id)
    2) docker run <container-id> (start container)

*   When "docker build ." command runs second time, it uses cache & rebuilds with cache as long as instructions in dockerfile are same. 

*   docker images can have tagged name instead of random id string
eg., docker build -t prashant/mydocker:latest .
    (docker id / Repoor Project name : varsion)

Quick note for windows
    ubuntu/mac ->    docker commit -c 'CMD ["redis-server"]' CONTAINERID
    windows -> docker commit -c "CMD 'redis-server'" CONTAINERID
